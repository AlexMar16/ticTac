#Administration Manual

##Introduction
This administration manual will take you through the process of setting up the project and deploying it on your website.

##Setup
To install and build the project on a fresh machine please reference the "Installation steps" in the developer manual.

##Install the Heroku toolbelt 
If you want to create another Heroku server or move the current one you will need the install the [Heroku toolbelt](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli). 

##Deployment
The server is automatically deployed on to our [website](http://mighty-brushlands-46890.herokuapp.com) everytime new code is added to the master branch. A failing version should never get through the deployment stage so a working version of the application is always live.
